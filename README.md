### Algorithms for descrete optimisation

### Lab1
Implementation of common graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, checking if a graph is bipartite, finding strongly connected components of a graph, topologically sorting a graph.

### Lab2
Modeling optimisation problems in Julia language for a solver.

### Lab3
Implementing and testing three versions of shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra, Dial and Radix. This exercise originated as a DIMACS programming challange.

### Lab4
Finding a maximum flow in a n-dimensional hypercube graph. Finding maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
